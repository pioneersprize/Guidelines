# Performance Improvments for Reed Solomon Erasure Coding

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Improve reed solomon erasure coding used in polkadot to reduce the static overhead the current implementation has regardless of the number of shards required.

### Project Details

- introduce SIMD instructions to the current implementation to improve performance for 1000+ validators
- implement a different algorithm that reduces the static table computation overhead for up to 1000 validators

The project is only concerned with the performance aspects of reed solomon erasure coding, nothing more, nothing less.

The API used by polkadot will not change, the side effects of breaking changes of internal behavior is not part of this work package.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Reed solomon erasure coding is used in the current polkadot implementation, let's make it better, to scale polkadot further
- Short term scalability, reducing CPU load and leaving more for network package processing

### Team's experience

I am a former parity employee, and did the initial implementation of the reed solomon erasure coding,
as well as performance measurments and the now decomissioned infrastructure automation for automated perf
around it.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

1. do performance measurements baseline
2. setup decommissioned CI infra again
3. add SIMD to the current implementation
4. implement a alternate version
5. measure and tune the alternate
6. determine a threshold, where which one is more performant
7. implement a dynamic switch over

All code implemented will be `rust` ðŸ¦€

Note that this is a discounted rate and shall not be assumed for further enquiries, since I actually would like to get this done.

## Future Plans

No plans, unless further optimization is required to bridge to a full zk-based approach.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

As stated, I did the initial impl. and I do have sufficient experience both with the theoretical background and the concrete implementation to get it done.
