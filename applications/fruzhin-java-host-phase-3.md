## Project Overview

### Overview

This proposal is a continuation of LimeChain’s previous proposal, [Java Full Node](https://github.com/pioneersprize/Polkadot-Pioneers-Prize/blob/main/applications/fruzhin-java-host-phase-2.md), which laid the groundwork for the Java authoring node implementation of the Polkadot Host that our team named Fruzhin. 

The presence of multiple client implementations is crucial for
a mature blockchain protocol like Polkadot, as it reduces the
vulnerability to undiscovered bugs and safeguards against centralization
of power and control.

Another pivotal aspect of this proposal is to provide the Java
communities with a functional Polkadot client. This would empower
enterprises to engage with the Polkadot Network using their preferred
programming language, ensuring their confidence in the capabilities of
the host system.

LimeChain’s team has already demonstrated the feasibility of a Java
Host by initially implementing it as a light client and later on
upgrading it to a full node. This proposal outlines the necessary steps
to advance the Host to the next milestone - authoring node.

### Project Details

Fruzhin’s еnd goal is to act as a relaying node, providing valuable
benefits to the Polkadot network by diversifying the client base. This
is significant because it helps to safeguard the network against the
concentration of power and control, preventing a single entity from
making unilateral decisions in permissionless protocols like Polkadot.
Additionally, client diversification contributes to reducing
vulnerability to undiscovered bugs and exploits, thereby enhancing the
overall security and resilience of the network. Currently, most nodes
are running the Rust-based client developed by Parity, with only a few
exceptions. However, Fruzhin’s efforts aim to encourage the adoption of
various clients, adding more diversity to the network and further
fortifying its decentralized nature. By promoting a healthy mixture of
clients, Fruzhin contributes to the long-term stability and
sustainability of the Polkadot ecosystem.

Moreover, implementing Fruzhin in Java will play a crucial role in
attracting a wider pool of talent to actively participate in and enrich
the Polkadot ecosystem. Over the past few decades, Java has consistently
ranked among the top 5 most widely used programming languages, boasting
a massive and thriving community. Notably, Java has also found
applications in the blockchain sphere, including its adoption in
Ethereum, where around 18% of the consensus nodes currently utilize a
Java-based consensus client - Teku.

To ensure a gradual development process, we have embraced an
incremental strategy, wherein each increment corresponds to a distinct
node type. As a result, the feature set naturally progresses from the
already accomplished Light Client in Phase 1 and Full node in Phase 2 to
an authoring node, and ultimately, the relaying node. This approach
allows us to build upon the achievements of each prior phase, steadily
advancing toward our final objective of having a fully functional
relaying node.

### Proposal objective(s) or solution(s)

The transition from Full Node to Authoring Node is a significant endeavour, given that up until now Fruzhin has only been a passive participant of the network. The biggest objective of this proposal is to advance our Host to becoming an active participant of the network by implementing block building and consensus protocols, namely BABE and GRANDPA.

Another high priority objective is to have an abundance of unit and integration tests that cover a wide range of scenarios that the Host could find itself it. This will reduce the chances of incompatibility problems, as well as give confidence in adopters.

Fruzhin uses wasmer-java to enable Host <-> Runtime communication. As such it’s an integral part of the node, however it currently lacks useful features like being able to deploy multiple binaries for different CPU architectures. Currently, this problem is handled locally in Fruzhin, which is suboptimal due to the increased size of the repository.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
    - The proposal will enable the network participants to utilize a
    Java-based Node Host implementation as a consensus client. The
    proposal’s milestones are designed to progress from a Full node to an
    Authoring node. This will significantly help to decentralize the network
    as upgrading to an active participant of the network who produces blocks
    and votes in GRANDPA will surely draw more new users in.
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers,
designers, your own user base, some dapp’s userbase, yourself)?
    - This solution helps all network participants who rely on Polkadot’s
    stability and consistency to conduct their activities safely and
    efficiently. This includes Node Operations, providers, validators, token
    holders, developers, and most importantly - the end users. By increasing
    the diversification of Host implementations, the proposal enhances
    decentralization within the network. More diversified client
    implementations reduce the risk of centralization, ensuring that no
    single entity gains excessive influence or control over the
    network.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
    - By diversifying the client implementations, it enhances protocol
    security and resilience. Having multiple clients reduces the risk of a
    single point of failure and makes the network less susceptible to
    potential attacks or vulnerabilities that may be specific to certain
    client implementations.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate /
Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
    - There are no other Java Host implementations.

| 0c. | Testing and Testing Guide | Not much testing will be needed for the changes in this milestone. |
| 1. | Research and implement a way to release all necessary binaries | Java has no way of interacting with wasm files and therefore we are using native functions - in this case Rust which makes Fruzhin platform dependant. The best way to deal with this problem is to have binaries for different OS+Chip combinations but GitHub doesn’t offer apple runners for free. There are probably other ways we can have the ARM binaries be built and that would help up remove the manual setup process in Fruzhin. |
| 2. | Logging | Add an abundance of logs of different levels so that Runtime calls can more easily be tracked and debugged. |
| 3. | Minor refactoring | There are a lot of parts in the code that could be refactored for better readability and effectiveness since they were written a long time ago with an older Rust version. |

## Future Plans

The main goal of Fruzhin is to serve as a relaying node. This means
that if there’s interest from the community and funding, proposals for
features related to relaying node will be created. Our hope is that if
Fruzhin has a strong impact, the larger ecosystem will provide the
funding needed for these efforts. If not, we’re prepared to fund these
endeavors ourselves, as long as Fruzhin remains important within the
ecosystem.

## Additional Information

At LimeChain, we believe in a multi-chain future, based on
interoperability and decentralization. Principles that are built into
the core of the Polkadot network. We have been firm believers in the
Polkadot ecosystem for the last 3+ years. As such, we have been
exploring different ways to add value to its developer community,
starting with Subsembly - a framework used to design and implement
Substrate runtimes in Assembly Script, the current development of
Gosemble, a Full node implementation in Java, and building a Parachain
Validation Conformance Testing suite.
