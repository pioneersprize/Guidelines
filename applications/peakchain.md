## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

**Tagline:** Rewarding every sustainable choice.  
**Description:**
PeakChain MoveUP is a move-to-earn app that incentivizes users to adopt eco-friendly
transportation by rewarding them with tokens, NFTs, and in-app points. The platform
combines blockchain technology, AI-enhanced tracking, and gamification to reduce carbon
footprints and promote sustainability. Users can participate in community challenges, access
a marketplace for NFTs, and monitor their performance metrics

**Integration with Polkadot:** The integration with Polkadot will be developed as part of the
roadmap to ensure scalability and compatibility with the Polkadot ecosystem.
**Interest in the Project:**
Our team is passionate about addressing global sustainability challenges using blockchain
technology. With Polkadot's robust ecosystem, we aim to create a scalable solution that
combines financial incentives and environmental impact.

### Project Details

**Functionalities:**

1.  **UI Components:** gamified experience, sustainability dashboards, and NFT AI generation.
2.  **Core Features:**

- Real-time tracking of steps and distance traveled.
- Gamified experience.
- Wallet integration (planned for the upcoming versions).
- AI-based transport mode detection.
- Gamified challenges and milestones.
- Wallet integration for seamless transactions.

3.  **Data Models:** APIs for mobility tracking, NFT minting, and rewards distribution.
4.  **Technology Stack:**

- Frontend: Flutter, Dart
- Backend: Node.js, TypeScript

5.  **Documentation:** Detailed architecture and API specs.
6.  **Proof of Concept:** MVP with mobility tracking and basic reward systems.

**Limitations:**

- The app will not provide general-purpose NFT trading outside its ecosystem.
- Proprietary components will not be open-source.

### Ecosystem Fit

**How the Project Fits in the Ecosystem:**  
PeakChain MoveUP addresses the need for sustainability-focused dApps in the Polkadot
ecosystem. By incentivizing eco-friendly mobility, the app bridges blockchain technology
with real-world environmental impact.

**Target Audience:**

- dApp developers and parachain projects.
- Sustainability and mobility enthusiasts.
- General blockchain and NFT users

**Needs Met:**
The project fulfills the need for gamified, incentive-driven sustainability platforms in the
Polkadot ecosystem.
**Similar Projects:**
While other projects focus on mobility or gamification, PeakChain MoveUP uniquely
combines sustainability rewards, blockchain integration, and AI tracking.
